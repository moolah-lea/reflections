When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have multiple collaborators/contributors to a project. Perhaps you have multiple workstations. Having a remote repository gives you the liberty of 
working on the cloud. You can virtually work from anywhere in that case. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because we operate on branches, sometimes certain changes you make locally are not meant to be released publicly. Like when you are trying to implement a new feature or patching a bug that requires a few files to be worked on and to do so without affecting the current working version available online. If you have multiple collaborators, not all changes are expected to be a great fit for the rest. You want to have a control mechanism in place to ensure only the working and accepted version are being commited and made online for others to use.
